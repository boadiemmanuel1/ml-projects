# VMD + LSTM: Hybrid Model for Bitcoin Price Forecasting

This project presents a hybrid approach that combines **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to improve the accuracy of Bitcoin price prediction. The raw price series is decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are then individually modeled using LSTM and aggregated for final forecasting.
